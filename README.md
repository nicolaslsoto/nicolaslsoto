My name is Nicolas Soto, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate at the University of Central Florida (UCF, Overall GPA 3.48).

I love continually learning and applying new technologies, especially when I can apply technologies in a way
that can influence, benefit, or help people, to make their lives better or easier in their every day lives!

I am currently actively seeking the perfect job oppurtunity that will allow me to grow my skills and apply them
towards my passion of helping others through the use of technology. Just as equally, I love to teach others and pass
on the knowledge that I hold.

I enjoy working in teams and buliding good relationships with my teammates, I always keep an open mind, and my best interest
is whats best for the team and the goal we are trying to acheive. I believe these are key virtues for any development team
to stand by in order to enjoy what they do and to yield the best results while doing it.
